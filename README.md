# Vision Toolkit Examples

This repository contains a growing collection of `.mgraph` example files for use with the [Vision Toolkit](https://github.com/VisionToolkit-Dev-Team/vision-toolkit). These examples are intended to help you get started quickly by demonstrating common inspection patterns, node usage, and graph configurations.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

Each file in this repository is a self-contained `.mgraph` configuration compatible with the Vision Toolkit runtime. Examples may include:

- Tag detection and classification
- Object counting
- Color-based filtering
- Edge detection and measurements
- Real-world production examples

## Getting Started

To use an example:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a `.mgraph` file using the [Vision Toolkit Editor](https://github.com/VisionToolkit-Dev-Team/vision-toolkit).
3. Run or modify it to suit your needs.

You can also access and search examples directly inside the Vision Toolkit interface via the built-in **Examples** browser.
